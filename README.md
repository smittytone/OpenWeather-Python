# OpenWeather-Python

Α Python integration for the OpenWeather API.

The class it contains allows you to make one of two possible calls to [OpenWeather’s API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).

Access to the API is controlled by key. [Register for developer access](https://openweathermap.org/appid) to obtain your key.

**Note** Rhis class does not parse the incoming data, which is highly complex. It is up to your application to extract the data you require.
